/** DataProcessor is a basic trait for any process that needs to be applied to the data. A DataProcessor
  * is, quite simply, sent a stream of data messages.
  *
  * DataMessageContent is streamed in, and can be handled at will. Anything that is sequence-sensitive
  * (such as method entries and exits) is guaranteed to be in order. Other unsequenced data (such as
  * thread and method name mappings) will arrive, but not in any sort of guaranteed order.
