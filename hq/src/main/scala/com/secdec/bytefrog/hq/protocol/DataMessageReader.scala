/** A "Pull" API for reading data events from a DataInputStream.
  * A DataMessageReader can read individual DataMessages from a
  * stream, one at a time. Each message is returned as a `Data`,
  * containing the particular `DataMessage` representation of the
  * message. In case of errors and EOF, the `IO.Error` and `IO.EOF`
  * case classes will be returned.
  *
  * "Pull" means that data can be "pulled" from the reader at will,
  * and that reading a stream doesn't need to happen all at once.
  * It is the opposite of a "push" API, where the parser "pushes"
  * data to a handler, and parsing is done in one shot.
