/**
 * An object that manages a collection of {@link DataBufferOutputStream}s,
 * allowing threads to acquire and release buffers in a thread-safe manner.
 * Buffer acquisition has two modes, "for reading" and "for writing". Acquiring
 * a buffer for reading will have different internal behavior than acquiring a
 * buffer for writing, but each operation will block until a buffer is
 * available, or until the current thread is interrupted.
 * 
 * Internally, a BufferPool uses three {@link ConcurrentLinkedQueue}s, with a
 * {@link Semaphore} to control access. Using this approach, the pool achieves
 * high availability, even for a large number of producer and consumer threads.

	 * a "fullness" factor of at least 0.9, it will be considered "full", and

	 * a buffer will exceed its internal capacity and need to be re-allocated. A
	 * buffer may still automatically re-allocate itself when a single writer
	 * thread adds a large number of bytes to that buffer before releasing it.
	 * Because of this, client code is encouraged to write data in relatively
	 * small chunks of less than 10% of the bufferLength at a time.

	 * @param numBuffers The number of initially-empty buffers. Note that the
	 *            number of buffers given will directly limit the number of
	 *            threads that may access the pool concurrently.
	 * @param bufferLengthHint The number of bytes initially allocated to each
	 *            buffer. Note that this number is not a hard limit, but if a
	 *            buffer grows beyond this threshold, it will not be available
	 *            for further writing until a reader thread clears and releases
	 *            it.
